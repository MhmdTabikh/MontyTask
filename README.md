# MontyTask

This demo is a .net 6 web api wth postgreSQl, for logging errors Serilog was used, Automapper for mapping,and Entity Framework as an ORM.
The database was created using Code First Migrations. Creation of the database has data seeded to it,the data can be found in MontyTask.Data.Models DatabaseSeed.
This demo is not final, some of the main CRUD operations are not implemented(delete or renew subscriptions,delete or update users,change password for users,etc..)
This demo is not intended to be a fully working project, it is just a showcase.
